# March 16

Today, I made this log-website, and hopefully it will help me keep track of everything I've done regarding sonification. I'm still not sure if it's the best for what I'm doing (and apparently I don't really know what I'm doing), but we'll see!

Today's goal is to explore how to remix midi files - I want to play with the file Dr. Graham sent me yesterday from the G. B. Greene image. I also want to take a look at jsynth too, and figure out how he sonified it.

## TwoTone
[TwoTone](https://twotone.io/) was suggested to me a while ago, but I explored it and it seems to no longer be working. They have a GitHub page, but the code didn't work either, so I'm scratching it off my list.

### SynthFont
SynthFont is something I found on a Google search, from this [website](https://www.chronocrash.com/forum/index.php?topic=628.0), which comes with instructions for using SynthFont and downloading sound fonts for it.

There's both a paid and free version, and you can guess which one I'm choosing. The free version is v1.754, so I'm going to check that out.


## SonicPi

## Freesound
Also, Meranda mentioned [Freesound](https://freesound.org) as a place for royalty-free sounds (I think you just have to give proper attribution or w/e).
