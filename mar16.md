# March 15

This is the start of a new website to track my work on my MRE. The theme will likely change in the future, but it's good enough for now.

March 15:
Dr. Graham and I messed around with two images:
- [G. B. Greene at a wharf on Lac Deschenes](https://photos.app.goo.gl/d95Mwv1ZPFXzsr6E6)
- [Fitzroy Ragged Chute](https://photos.app.goo.gl/vd7wVFt24BcptdF1A)

Used a modified version of https://jythonmusic.me/sonifying-images/ (modified and held by Dr. Graham) to create a series of sonifications, included in the non-website portion of this repository.
