To send to Dr. Graham:

- struggling with the historic justifications for image sonification *instead* of data sonifications

So...
- imagining a soundwalk [1] using relational positioning, so that it can be located anywhere.
- features a map [2] and a constantly running nature track to show that sound/nature is present with or without mediation/human presence [3]. 
- sonifications that run on top of the base track, triggered based on relation to where the person starts/the direction they face [4].
  - geosonifications [5], but the sonifications feature auditory icons focused on industrial noise [6] and that follow noise music theory [7, 8]
    - Polli states that soundwalks are in protest of constant industrial noise assaulting sonic environments, except I would like to do the reverse and take the base track of a natural sonic environment and reintroduce industrial noise as the sounds of data (ie: log footage from LAC)
        - this has political implications [9, 10] and allows for a connection with acoustic ecology [11, 12] through the conjunction of the base track with the sonifications and the interplay of real and constructed environment through the noise backdrop and geosonifications.
        - the choice to focus on auditory nature of an environment "defines historic and ongoing social relations of humans to that environment" [13]; 
        - my choice to focus noise versus music is deliberate [14]





[1] Westerkamp (1996): sounds walks as embodied method of connecting with sound while moving through space/place; argues that the recording, manipulation, and broadcast of soundwalks can bring bring listeners closer to the environment - to "awaken curiosity and create a desire for deeper knowledge and info about our own and other places and culture; soundscapes create a clearer sense of place and beloning for composer and listener through artistic transmissions of meanings about place, time, environment, and listening
[2] to allow for a discussion of mapping as inherently colonial and the connection to the industrialization of the river and settlement of the area as colonial activity 
[3] Cox (2018): "artists have become attracted to those domains against which music has always defined itself: noise, silence, and environmental sound; not only aesthetically but also philosophically significant, revealing sound to be a continuous material flow to which human expressions contribute but which precedes and exceeds those expressions" and experiences.
[4] for accessibility I think it should also be click-able for those who can't trigger it via movement
[5] Polli (2011): "geosonification, a term created by the author to describe the sonification of data from the natural world inspired by the soundscape" involves data-driven sonifications with soundscape-style references tossed in
[6] Polli (2011): soundwalkers move through space in silent protest of both the visual dominance in contemporary culture and the constant industrial and electroacoustic noise assaulting our sonic environments
[7] Priest (2013): “Noise music is a genre of music that is characterised by the expressive use of noise within a musical context. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound. Noise music includes a wide range of musical styles and sound-based creative practices that feature noise as a primary aspect.”
[8] Sangild (2002): “Noises are the sounds which used to be denounced as non-musical. To include noise in music thus still has an effect and bears a certain aesthetic power.”
[9] Soria-Martinez (2017): representing past soundscapes (or alluding to them in the case of these geosonifications) has political implications regarding returning past memory to the present, etc.
[10] Polli (2011): "Soundwalking and field recording can be activist practices that address pollution and preservation through the organization of groups of people undertaking subversive activities, through the uncovering of unheard sounds and vibrational signals, and through collective documentary action, as demonstrated in the author’s NYSoundmap project."
[11] Truax: acoustic ecology is a discipline that analyzes how we interpret, and are affected by, natural and artificial sounds around us; could be useful in conjunction with the soundwalk and the interplay of real and constructed environment through the noise backdrop and sonifications.
[12] Polli (2011): "When one closely examines soundscape, audification, and sonification in relation to the Acoustic Ecology movement, it is possible to re-establish a link between data, communication, and the environment"; "The practice of acoustic ecology generally, and soundwalking and phonography specifically, provide alternative pathways for understanding the natural and man-made environment."
