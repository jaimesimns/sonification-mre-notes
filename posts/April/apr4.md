Workshop Notes

My research focuses on steamboats and the role they played in the industrialization and colonization of the Ottawa River. I plan to represent/examine this through an audiowalk, with a scaled-down map of the Ottawa River superimposed over the space between the Portage Bridge and the Champlain Bridge along the SJAM trail. It will include a constantly running nature track to show that sound/nature is present with or without mediation/human presence, and is augmented with data sonifications triggered at certain locations.
