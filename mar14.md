(This is a pre-dated post, the website was created later).

While trying to figure out sonification and image sonification, I played around with [Photosounder](https://photosounder.com/) and [AnthemScore](https://www.lunaverus.com/). 
Photosounder was shared with me by Dr. Graham, and is a paid software - of course, I used the free demo. Photosounder uses the light/dark of an image to create sound. You can load an image or an mp3 file into the software, and it will respectively create a sonification or an image. 

I tested Photosounder using an image of the [Ann Sisson](https://photos.app.goo.gl/XAxb2cuM9fEZh1ZP8). Photosounders reads the image from left to right, and its reading of the Ann Sisson produced [this sound](/ann-sisson-fullbw.mp3). 

See the desktop here:

It's a very busy noise that's rather unpleasant to listen to, so instead I created a line drawing of the Ann Sisson to test how that would sound. It sounded [like this](ann-sisson-linedrawing.mp3). 

I then took that mp3 file and tossed it into AnthemScore. AnthemScore is technically meant for note transcription for piano, but when you put an mp3 into it, it shows the general map of the image against a piano scale. You can draw notes onto that mp3 image, which is how I ended up with [this sound](/Piano-linedrawing.mp3).

This is the desktop view of AnthemScore, with the sound-map and drawn notes: ![Ann Sisson - AnthemScore](https://photos.app.goo.gl/VhW86zPQ7KvmENzd8). It's a bit of a mess since I was just testing it, but I chose to use 128th notes to allow for the greatest level of detail when drawing the notes on. There is no means to control the duration of the notes, unfortunately, besides not putting a note right behind it - which is an issue when trying to convey a drawing to notation. It is possible to create a transcription of the notation though, which gave me this interesting image: ![Piano Notation - Ann Sisson](https://photos.app.goo.gl/aQ9J25x7WGQ8Ch4V9), though it seems to run off the page and I haven't been able to fix that. Likely, it's because I'm using it for a very unintended purpose!

Neither of these methods seem exceedingly promising, so it's onto the next one.
