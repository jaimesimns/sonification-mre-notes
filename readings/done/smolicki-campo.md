Smolicki, Jacek, and Candace Campo. "Soundscapes as Archives: Traces and absences of the aural past in Vancouver." _Seismograph_. April 6, 2021. HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.48233/SEISMOGRAF2611

This work centers on Jacek Smolicki's _Intertidal Room_, where "the composition explores how the entanglement of historical, environmental, and cultural processes at the city's intertidal zones has been reflected in their present soundscapes." It focuses on "the part concerned with Vancouver and British Columbia's colonial history." "Intertidal Room is an attempt to practically engage in rethinking and reconfiguring some of the assumptions that have underlain the field of acoustic ecology and soundscape studies as conceptualized and practiced by the World Soundscape Project."

Jacek "propose(s) that besides manifesting the acoustically present, soundscapes should also be heard as specific archives that comprise both traces and absences of the aural past. If carefully attended to, practices of listening, soundwalking, and soundscape composition can obtain the function of aesthetic and critical modes through which we can sense, access, work with, and give justice to these contested archives of the aural."

### Revisiting the World Soundscape Project
"Founded by Canadian composer Raymond M. Schafer, the World Soundscape Project (WSP) was a research initiative initiated to rethink our relationship with the environment by turning attention towards sounds (Schafer 1977)."

"In their recently edited volume, Milena Droumeva and Randolph Jordan opened up the legacy of WSP to such an assessment (Droumeva and Jordan 2019). The authors suggested that today's acoustic ecology must function from a different vantage point to that which shaped the work of WSP fifty years ago: "one that tells a different story about how the world is and how we want it to be, to acknowledge the privilege upon which the field was founded and find new paths out into society at large" (ibid. p.5)."

Among voices who advocate critical but constructive revisions of WSP tradition and its heritage, some have suggested a radical turn to that which the project historically left silent (Akiyama 2015). In this view, the WSP archive can be seen as not only a repository of the aural content but, more importantly, an indicator of that which it might have historically excluded. (Work of Randolph Jones and his concept of unsettled listening could be a good example here, see Bell Tower of False Creek). From this perspective, the WSP's omissions become starting points for necessary inquiries that soundscape studies need to engage with.

Other voices have called for the use of WSP as a departure point towards a more diversified reading and writing of our past, present, and future sound cultures. For example, a necessity for infusing acoustic ecology with more radical ethics is what Hildegard Westerkamp, one of the WSP members, has been flagging consistently over the years (2015, 2019). In her writing on the disruptive potential of listening, she has suggested shifting energy from often repetitive and even superficial critique of WSP tradition to addressing essential questions concerning social justice, environmental crisis, intersectionality, and postcolonialism. In sum, if approached ethically, critically, and creatively, some of the WSP's methodological approaches and listening techniques can still help constructively address those critical questions while simultaneously contributing to the necessary revision of acoustic ecology at large.
