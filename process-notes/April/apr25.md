This is a quick note to state my intentions: I want to use my citations as 'care,' following _______'s. I want to push the mainstream citations from old white men and go father into the field, to diversify my citations but also to cite who I want and who inspires me, as opposed to who people think I should cite.

I want this to be an experiment in sound, but also an experiment in citations.

queer ecology, black feminist ecology, queer sound theory, trans sound theory, feminist sound theory(?).

Queer, trans, Black diapora theory are not only for queer, trans, and Black diaspora topics. They can and should apply to the environment, ecology, sound, etc.
