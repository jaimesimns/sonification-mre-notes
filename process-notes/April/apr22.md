I organized a Q&A session with a few second-year MA students, and this was the most helpful advice given:

Submit MRE by April 15; include flex time in that

Outlining methodology
-	What methodology and why you chose to use them
-	Clear mission statements bc digital project; what it was and what it’s trying to do
-	State if exploratory
-	Put a timeline into proposal
o	Month by month breakdown
Identifying gap/articulating gap
Don’t let it turn only into lit review
Positionality?
Recommends narrativity and performance
Tie to public history re performativity, affect, embodiment, etc. 
Devlogs, website for final work
Explain that you are planning to use [this] DH technique but that things may change or platforms may be removed or further developed
Theories about the methodologies you’re using
-	In proposal gesture that you know things and will read the things

How much reading to do in advance? – not a ton; can just toss some in there that are related
Readers: paul will just give it; for the actual MRE you can suggest a few to your supervisor
Submit it, people read it, give comments and edits, you have a week to edit it, and the you’re done

Mindmeister good for mind maps or nuclino
